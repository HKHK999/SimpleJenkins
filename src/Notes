to run my automation scripts(tests) (like: regression/smoke/etc) I need Jenkins  (for testers/devs)
(because we run tests on separate computer)
(fetches/pull all my tests from GitHub, executes test cases, if something failes - sends report,
can also see who wrote the test, if it fails - sends to that person email with report that test is failed)

Can also do: we can time tests (have schedule of executing tests): run tests every mondays, every 10 days,
if new feature appears - can execute all tests (regression test)

devs - can buid and deploy

good thing: Jenkins supports many plugins


!!! Building process:
converting source code to .dmd ??? file, so we run file, not code from ide

+ Jenkins is easy to modify, extend
+ free, open-source
+ easy to detect issue in the code (notifies dev, shows the place where is the issue)

Jenkin before tester's tests automatically check if there is any syntax issues

after pushing code, says that commit has problems!

Steps:
(How to link remote repo to local)
create new repo on GitHub (copy remote link)
in IDE click on VCS - enable version control integration
choose Git
button Git pops up - click on it - Manage Remotes-add url of remote repo
push code from local PC to remote repo

How to commit code and push it (2 approaches, can be console, now will do via IDE):
click main - commit - push
